I used binwalk -e on the image 
this gave me a folder which had a text file which was actually a jpeg, just use file on it to get the details
after renaming we get an image, usebinwalk on the image to get a folder
after entering the folder we get another set of files of name 6AF90
perform binwalk and you find the flag in a text file
