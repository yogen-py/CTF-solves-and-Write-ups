We have a png image with broken critical chunks
I track down all the critical chunks and fix them
On fixing the image we get a screenshot of Matlab code
There's a weird string which we copy paste onto Dcode
We find out thatis Fractionated Morse Cipher
On decoding we  get FLAGGHEXFRACTIONATEDMORSEENCODER 
On change according to the Flag format
The flag is FLAG{GHEXFRACTIONATEDMORSEENCODER}
